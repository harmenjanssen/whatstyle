# Hi!

I'm **Harmen Janssen**. I've been making websites for well over a decade.  
Most of that time was and is still spent at [GRRR](https://grrr.nl), a great agency for Meaningful Matters. Currently I'm leading the development team.

I'm passionate about **sports**, **cooking**, **music**, **functional programming**, **vim**, **git**.

[I used to run a blog](/articles), but would recommend [GRRR's Tech blog](https://grrr.tech) where I do most of my writing these days.
