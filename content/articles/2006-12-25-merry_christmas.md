<p>Just a short post to wish you all a very merry Christmas.</p>
{{< /intro >}}

 Today we're gonna head off to my girlfriend's grandmother for dinner with the family and the day after that we will go and visit my parents. It's your classic Christmas, visiting both families, and it might be clich√©, but it will be the first Christmas in two years we will actually spend with our family (due to us both having to work around this time last years).

 So good days to all of you, enjoy!
