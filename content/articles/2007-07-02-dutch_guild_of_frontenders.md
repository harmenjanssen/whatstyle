<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org">Peter-Paul Koch</a> is tired of the current state of professionalism in HTML development in Dutch web design agencies, and has formed the Dutch Guild Of Front-Enders.</p>
{{< /intro >}}

 This guild is formed in order to point Dutch agencies to the importance of serious, professional front-end developers (instead of HTML being written by designers or backend programmers who don't care or understand the importance of progressive enhancement, semantics and/or separation of content and presentation).

 I believe this is a great initiative and have immediately joined the mailing list. If you are working in the Netherlands as a web developer, you should do so as well. If we can gather a large enough number of participants, we might be able to really turn things around and lift front-end programming to a whole new and more professional level. Developers and especially agencies really **must** start taking front-end coding seriously.

Please read PPK's [article](http://www.quirksmode.org/branche/) and consider joining.
