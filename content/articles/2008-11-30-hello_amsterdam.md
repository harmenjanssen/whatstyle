<p>After a year of working for <a href="http://dutchinternetworks.nl">Dutch Internet Works</a>, I've decided to leave Baarn and join <a href="http://www.grrr.nl">Grrr Medialab</a> in Amsterdam.</p>
{{< /intro >}}

I have some prior experience with working with Grrr (mainly the ["Museumnacht"](http://n8.nl) (museum night) websites) and it always was an amazing collaboration.

After a while of circlejerking around eachother, we finally found eachother again and as of come Monday I will be commuting between Harderwijk and Amsterdam.

I really am very exciting about going to work, 'cause they have some highly creative projects waiting for me, which are sure to keep me busy and challenged.

Guys, I'm glad we finally got our act together! I'm sure we're gonna achieve new creative heights.  
 I'll see you guys Monday. :)
