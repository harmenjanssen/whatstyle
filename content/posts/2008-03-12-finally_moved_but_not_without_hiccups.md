<p>
Whatstyle has finally arrived at its new location over at <a href="http://www.ccchosting.nl">CCC Hosting</a>. Before the move could be completed however, I made an ass out of myself.</p>
<p>My <code>@whatstyle.net</code> address was my contact address over at the new host, which was, obviously, momentarily down during the move.<br>
Hence, I was unable to receive the  email containing the new FTP information and stuff like that, resulting in a couple of days of me having no website nor email address.</p>
<p>All is well again, so keep checking back regularly for updates. Also, due to the downtime, my latest article about <a href="http://www.whatstyle.net/articles/43/formatting_css_how_not_to_do_it">formatting CSS</a> might have gone unnoticed. Do take a look :)</p>
