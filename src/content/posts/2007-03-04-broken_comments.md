Whatstyle has recently updated its MySQL version to version 5. Yay!</p>
<p>The upgrade was not without bumps and bruises however...</p>

Due to a MySQL error comments are not inserted in the database. I'm working together with my host to solve this MySQL error, so it shouldn't take long before Whatstyle accepts comments again.

Stay tuned!
