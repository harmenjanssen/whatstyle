<p>I wanted to do this for a long time: set up a repository for myself with all my often used PHP classes, so I have easy access to the latest versions and whatnot.</p>
<p>This has now happened. This week I put together a little something to browse my package directory and auto-generate API information and stuff.</p>
<p>I thought others might benefit from it as well, so I've made it public on <a href="http://whatphp.net">whatphp.net</a>.</p>

Currently, the repository sports only four classes (two of which are abstract, even) and only two of 'em are documented. I will add more classes and documentation when I find time. The reason this thing costs time is I have to rewrite my classes in a certain format (especially the comment blocks), so my API-script can auto-generate an API page from the file. And there's documentation of course, which doesn't just fall from the sky :-)

If you're a PHP-developer, check it out, maybe you can benefit from it. Or you can send me tips on how to improve my code.

I'd love to hear from you!
