Inspired by comments on <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200709/scrap_text_resize_widgets_and_teach_people_how_to_resize_text/">Roger Johansson's article about text resizing widgets</a>, I created a text-resizing widget that does not rely on scripting. CSS only!</p>

Check out [example 1](http://www.whatstyle.net/examples/css-text-resizer.html) and [example 2](http://www.whatstyle.net/examples/css-text-resizer-2.html).

These experiments are just for fun and do **not** work across all browsers. In fact, it only works in a tiny selection of browsers, due to its use of the `:target` pseudo-selector. Since it's not a very serious bit of code, I only tested in Firefox.

It was nice to see it can be done though, even if the markup is far from ideal.
