<p>I've been meaning to write this post for a couple of weeks now, but I've deliberately kept my spare time computer-free (well, mostly. You know how that goes).</p>
<p>I'm happy to announce, though, that as of the first of December 2007, I've been working for <a href="http://dutchinternetworks.nl">Dutch Internet Works</a>.</p>

Boy, it wasn't easy to take this step. I've been very much in doubt about continuing my freelance carreer, for a load of different reasons. On the other hand, I've had just as much doubts about starting to work for someone else.

### Why?

Two main reasons, really; colleagues and money.

#### Colleagues

Freelancing for about one and a half year had made me a bit of a hermit. I've been working in my own office, in my own time, with 90% of the time no people physically present in the room. This is not necessarily a bad thing. I like to be on my own and make my own rules, but lately I started to get a bit tired of it.  
 Also, I started to notice that having no people around you is not a good thing, mentally. My advice to freelancers; go out! Participate in whatever, communicate with others in the field, join clubs. I never took the time to do stuff like this and experienced the negative impact of it first-hand. Do yourself a favor and be smarter than I've been.

#### Money

Another, maybe more capitalist reason, was money. While I've never really had any financial trouble, my income has been very variable. My girlfriend and I have been wanting to move to another place for some months and, for example, mortgages have been an uncertain subject. I really was ready for a fixed income. It gives me the freedom to worry about what kind of kitchen we would like, instead of a stupid thing like money.

### Whatstyle

Working for Dutch Internet Works has been a great experience. I've had a nice first month in which we fired up some interesting projects. There's some really challenging technical stuff going on at the moment, in which I can pour my heart and soul.

Alongside this new start I want to give Whatstyle a revamp. I've been neglecting the blog for way too long and now is the time to make a change. I'm going to try and write an article a week, at least.  
 I believe I have the experience to provide dummies with instructive articles and therefore the responsibility to do so. Hold on to your <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> readers and expect more posts in the near future.

I've also got a redesign planned, but in order for me to keep the stress levels to a minimum, that may take a while to realise.  
 The articles will return, though. I promise.
