<a href="http://freerice.com">The UN World Food Program has created a game to gather food for third-world countries.</a><br>
In the game, you have to guess the correct synonym for an English word. For non-native speakers it can actually be quite challenging and educational.

Below every question is a different ad, and that way various advertisers sponsor this initiative. I think it's a great idea and gladly link to it. Apart from being a great new, inventive way of helping others, the game is actually a nice use of modern web technologies like <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and DOM scripting.</p>
