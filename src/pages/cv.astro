  <h2>Skills</h2>

  <ul class="skills">
    <li>
      I write high quality PHP code. I focus on maintainability and testability.
      I'm knowledgable about best practices like the SOLID principles, Gang of
      Four design patterns and Domain-Driven Design.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a lot of experience planning small and large web applications and
      their architecture. I can account for scale, but can also be pragmatic. I
      have the experience to know when to apply both.
    </li>
    <li>
      I lead a growing team of developers. I coach their personal development
      and I'm a sparring partner to solve day-to-day technical problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      As tech lead I'm responsible for setting the course of the company's
      overall technical output. I ensure the team's technical choices are
      aligned with that strategy.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm a proficient (technical) writer. I'm able to explain complex technical
      topics in documentation and blog posts. For a sampling, see{" "}
      <a href="https://norday.tech/authors/harmen-janssen/">
        my writing on the Norday Tech blog.
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      I have solid experience with all of the three different front-end
      technologies; HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know their distinct domains and
      the way they interact with one another.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next to object-oriented programming I've studied functional programming in
      JavaScript and Haskell. I've created{" "}
      <a href="https://github.com/grrr-amsterdam/garp-functional">
        a library bringing functional programming paradigms to PHP
      </a>
      .
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a general interest in programming languages, and am able to quickly
      pick up new ones.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a decent understanding of accessibility, and I'm very motivated to
      put out accessible front-end code. I consider inclusivity to be an
      important value.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a solid understanding of Git. On numerous occasions, I have helped
      teammates who ran into trouble. I've formulated our general Git workflow,
      given multiple internal presentations and have written multiple articles
      on the subject.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have successfully divided applications into microservice-based
      architectures.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a good understanding of the AWS landscape and I'm experienced in
      various of their services, such as Lambda, APIGateway, DynamoDb and
      others.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've introduced GitHub workflows to my team, and have helped set up the
      current CI pipelines.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have experience working with Terraform, Serverless, and other
      architecture-as-code frameworks to manage infrastructure.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've completely refactored a large legacy codebase into a modern Laravel
      application.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Personal interests</h2>

  <ul class="skills">
    <li>I'm the father of a pretty cool boy and girl.</li>
    <li>
      I'm an experienced amateur cook. I take cooking very seriously and strive
      to really understand the techniques. When I'm totally exhausted or
      stressed, cooking lifts me up.
    </li>
    <li>
      I love doing sports. I'm into calisthenics, handstands, kickboxing, and
      running. If I wasn't suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee, I would
      probably be playing basketball a lot.
    </li>
    <li>I read quite a lot of books.</li>
    <li>
      I like bird watching. Being out in nature and searching for birds calms me
      down. ðŸª¶
    </li>
